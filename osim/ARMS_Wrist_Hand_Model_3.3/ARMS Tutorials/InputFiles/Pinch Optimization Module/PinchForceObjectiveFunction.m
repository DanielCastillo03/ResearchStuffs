%PINCHFORCEOBJECTIVEFUNCTION: This is an objective function to optimize pinch
%force from a computational OpenSim hand model. This function takes in
%activations for the individual muscles, updates the control file for a
%forward dynamic simulation, and then runs the forward dynamic simulation
%via a predefined setup file. The objective value is Pinch force which is
%defined as the magnitude of the constraint force between a massless body and the
%distal thumbtip
