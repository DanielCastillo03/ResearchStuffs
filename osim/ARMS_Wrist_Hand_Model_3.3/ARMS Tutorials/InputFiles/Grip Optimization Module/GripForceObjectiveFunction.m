%GRIPFORCEOBJECTIVEFUNCTION: This is an objective function to optimize grip
%force from a computational OpenSim hand model. This function takes in
%activations for the individual muscles, updates the control file for a
%forward dynamic simulation, and then runs the forward dynamic simulation
%via a predefined setup file. The objective value is Grip force which is
%defined as the magnitude of the JRF between a massless body and the
%thridmc minus a penalty term for wrist motion
